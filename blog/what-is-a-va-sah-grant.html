                <p>If you're a disabled veteran struggling with accessibility in your home, the VA Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant might be the answer you've been looking for. This grant can provide significant funding to help you build a new accessible home or modify your existing one—and you don't have to pay it back.</p>

                <p>After 20 years of working with veterans on SAH projects here in North Alabama, I've seen firsthand how life-changing this program can be. Let me break down everything you need to know.</p>

                <h2>WHAT EXACTLY IS THE SAH GRANT?</h2>

                <p>The Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) Grant is a benefit provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to help veterans with certain service-connected disabilities build, buy, or modify a home to meet their accessibility needs.</p>

                <p>Unlike a loan, <strong>this is a grant—you don't pay it back</strong>. The VA provides the funds directly to help cover the cost of making your home wheelchair accessible or adapting it for other mobility needs.</p>

                <h2>HOW MUCH CAN YOU GET?</h2>

                <p>For 2026, the maximum SAH Grant amount is <strong>$126,526</strong>. This amount increases each year to keep pace with construction costs.</p>

                <p>Here's the thing many veterans don't realize: you can use this grant up to <strong>six times</strong> throughout your lifetime, as long as you don't exceed the maximum total amount. So if your needs change over time, or you move to a new home, you may be able to use remaining grant funds for additional modifications.</p>

                <h2>WHO QUALIFIES FOR THE SAH GRANT?</h2>

                <p>To qualify for the SAH Grant, you must have a service-connected disability that results in one or more of the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Loss or loss of use of both legs</li>
                    <li>Loss or loss of use of both arms</li>
                    <li>Loss or loss of use of one leg and one arm</li>
                    <li>Blindness in both eyes (with light perception only) plus loss or loss of use of one leg</li>
                    <li>Certain severe burns</li>
                    <li>Loss or loss of use of one lower extremity (after September 11, 2001) that requires the use of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you're not sure whether you qualify, the best thing to do is apply. The VA will review your medical records and make a determination.</p>

                <h2>WHAT CAN YOU USE THE GRANT FOR?</h2>

                <p>The SAH Grant can be used for a wide range of accessibility modifications, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Building a new wheelchair accessible home</strong> from the ground up</li>
                    <li><strong>Buying an existing home</strong> and making it accessible</li>
                    <li><strong>Modifying your current home</strong> with features like roll-in showers, wheelchair ramps, wider doorways, and accessible kitchens</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Common projects I work on with veterans include zero-threshold <a href="/roll-in-showers.html">roll-in showers</a>, wheelchair ramps, widened hallways and doorways, lowered countertops, and grab bars throughout the home.</p>

                <h2>HOW DOES THE PROCESS WORK?</h2>

                <p>Here's a simplified overview of the SAH Grant process:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Apply for the grant</strong> through the VA (you can apply online at VA.gov or through your regional VA office)</li>
                    <li><strong>Receive your Certificate of Eligibility</strong> once the VA approves your application</li>
                    <li><strong>Find a qualified contractor</strong> who has experience with SAH projects and VA requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Work with your contractor</strong> to design your accessible home or modifications</li>
                    <li><strong>Submit plans to the VA</strong> for approval</li>
                    <li><strong>Begin construction</strong> once plans are approved</li>
                    <li><strong>VA inspection</strong> ensures the work meets all requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Final payment</strong> is made to the contractor</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The whole process can take several months, but having an experienced contractor makes a huge difference. A good contractor will handle the paperwork, communicate with the VA on your behalf, and keep the project moving.</p>

                <h2>WHY WORK WITH A SAH-EXPERIENCED CONTRACTOR?</h2>

                <p>Not every contractor understands the VA's specific requirements for SAH projects. Working with someone who has experience means:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your project is designed to meet VA standards from the start</li>
                    <li>Paperwork is handled correctly, avoiding delays</li>
                    <li>The contractor knows how to communicate with VA representatives</li>
                    <li>Inspections go smoothly because the work is done right</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I've completed over 50 SAH projects throughout my career, and I've learned that the details matter. A contractor who cuts corners or doesn't understand the requirements can cost you time and money.</p>

                <h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>

                <p>If you think you might qualify for the SAH Grant, here's what I recommend:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Check your eligibility</strong> by visiting <a href="https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VA.gov's housing grants page</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Apply for the grant</strong> if you haven't already</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact a qualified contractor</strong> to discuss your needs and what's possible</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Even if you're just exploring your options, I'm happy to answer questions. Building accessible homes for veterans is what I do, and I believe every veteran deserves to live independently in a home that works for them.</p>
