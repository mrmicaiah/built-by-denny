                            <h3>Do I have to pay back the SAH Grant?</h3>
                            <p>No. The SAH Grant is a benefit, not a loan. You do not have to repay any of the funds used for approved modifications or construction.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3>Can I use the grant more than once?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. You can use the SAH Grant up to 3 times, as long as the total amount doesn't exceed the maximum grant limit. This is helpful if you move or need additional modifications later.</p>

                            <p>Yes, but it's important to choose a contractor experienced with VA SAH Grant projects. They need to understand VA requirements, documentation, and inspection processes. An inexperienced contractor can cause delays and complications.</p>

                            <p>The timeline varies, but typically: eligibility determination takes 2-4 weeks, plan approval takes 2-4 weeks, and construction time depends on the scope of work. Working with an experienced contractor helps keep things on track.</p>
